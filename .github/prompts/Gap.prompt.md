Here is a prompt template designed for an AI coding agent to perform a detailed gap analysis between documentation and source code.

### AI Agent Prompt: Gap Analysis (Documentation vs. Implementation)

**Role:** You are an AI code analysis agent. Your task is to perform a precise gap analysis by meticulously comparing the provided software documentation against the provided source code.

**Objective:** Identify and report *all* discrepancies, omissions, and conflicts between what the documentation *says* and what the code *does*.

-----

### **Inputs**

**1. Documentation:**

`docs/documentation/UI/DeskOps-DashboardGuide.md`

**2. Source Code:**

`apps/web/src`

-----

### **Analysis Instructions**

Perform a bi-directional analysis based on the inputs above.

1.  **Documentation-to-Code Analysis (Find Missing Features):**

      * For every feature, function, class, parameter, and behavior described in the documentation, verify its existence in the source code.
      * Identify anything that is **documented but not implemented**.

2.  **Code-to-Documentation Analysis (Find Undocumented Features):**

      * For every public-facing function, method, class, API endpoint, and key logic in the source code, verify its presence in the documentation.
      * Identify anything that is **implemented but not documented**.

3.  **Discrepancy Analysis (Find Conflicts):**

      * For features that exist in *both*, compare the implementation details against the documentation.
      * Identify all conflicts, including:
          * **Parameter Mismatches:** (e.g., different name, type, or order).
          * **Return Value Mismatches:** (e.g., documentation says `string`, code returns `object`).
          * **Behavioral Conflicts:** (e.g., documentation says it handles errors by `throwing`, code handles errors by `returning null`).
          * **Outdated Information:** (e.g., documentation refers to old function names or deprecated logic).
          * **Incorrect Examples:** (e.g., code examples in the docs that will fail or produce different results).

-----

### **Required Output Format**

Generate a structured report. For each gap found, provide a clear description, reference the specific location in both the documentation and code (if applicable), and categorize it. In `docs/agents/GapAnalysisReport.*.md`, use the following format:

-----

### **Gap Analysis Report**

**Summary:**
[Provide a brief one-paragraph summary of the overall alignment between the code and documentation.]

-----

#### 1. Missing Features (Documented, but NOT in Code)

  * **Gap:** [Describe the feature documented but not found.]
  * **Documentation Reference:** [Quote or reference the exact part of the documentation.]
  * **Severity:** [High/Medium/Low]

-----

#### 2. Undocumented Features (In Code, but NOT in Docs)

  * **Gap:** [Describe the function, method, or behavior found in the code.]
  * **Code Reference:** [Provide the function/class name or code snippet, e.g., `function calculateInterest(rate, principal)`]
  * **Severity:** [High/Medium/Low]

-----

#### 3. Implementation Discrepancies (Conflicts)

  * **Gap:** [Describe the conflict.]
  * **Documentation Reference:** [Quote or reference the doc text.]
  * **Code Reference:** [Provide the conflicting code snippet.]
  * **Analysis:** [Explain the exact mismatch, e.g., "Documentation states the parameter is `userID`, but the code implementation uses `userId`."]
  * **Severity:** [High/Medium/Low]
